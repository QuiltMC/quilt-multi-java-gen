# Quilt Multi Java Gen

This is an experimental project to convert an `@Sealed` annotation into a proper java 17 `sealed` keyword (in source code), to allow projects to publish on Java 8 and allow consumers to benefit from Java 17 features (like sealed types), and particularly the Java 21 feature of Pattern Matching for Switch for those types.
